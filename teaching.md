As a scholar-teacher -- and liberal arts college graduate -- I consider student instruction to be an important part of my academic life. In addition to TAing at Notre Dame, my teaching experience includes the following:
- Instructor in the [Duke University Talent Identification Program](https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies), an intensive summer program for gifted high school students.
- Coach of the mock trial team at Adams High School, a public high school in South Bend.

TA experience at Notre Dame:
- Civil Liberties and Civil Rights (Professor Matthew E.K. Hall)
- Free Speech and the First Amendment (Professor Matthew E.K. Hall)
- American Politics (Professor Ben Radcliff)
- Introduction to Socialism (Professor Ben Radcliff)
