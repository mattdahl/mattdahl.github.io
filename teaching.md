title: Teaching
---

As a scholar-teacher -- and liberal arts college graduate -- student instruction is an important part of my academic life. Besides TAing at Notre Dame, I also teach in the following capacities:
- As an instructor in the [Duke Talent Identification Program](https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies), an intensive summer program for gifted high school students.
- As a coach of the mock trial team at Adams High School, a public high school in South Bend.
