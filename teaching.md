As a liberal arts college graduate, I consider student instruction to be an important part of my academic life. In addition to serving as a TA, I've also taught in the following capacities:
- As an instructor in the [Duke University Talent Identification Program](https://tip.duke.edu/programs/summer-studies), an intensive summer program for gifted high school students.
- As a coach of the [mock trial team at Adams High School](https://twitter.com/INBarFoundation/status/1231389455451328512), a public high school in South Bend, IN.

At Notre Dame, I've TA'd for the following classes:
- Civil Liberties and Civil Rights (Professor Matthew E.K. Hall)
- Free Speech and the First Amendment (Professor Matthew E.K. Hall)
- American Politics (Professor Ben Radcliff)
- Introduction to Socialism (Professor Ben Radcliff)
