Within CPT, my current project is titled "More than Method: Laozi, Heidegger, and the Ontology of Comparative Political Theory." Paper available on request. Abstract below:

> Comparative political theory (CPT) is experiencing a crisis in methodology. Its literature is consumed with debates about the “how” rather than the “what”; disputes over procedure sideline substantive political inquiry. In this paper, I argue that this fixation on methodology is not only distracting but dangerous: By focusing so much on the role of method, CPT unwittingly propagates Western assumptions about both the nature of politics (political ontology) and the nature of academic research (political epistemology), undercutting its professed goal to deparochialize the discipline. To show this, I examine the twentieth-century cross-cultural encounter between Heidegger and Laozi and recover their shared concept of “the Way” (道, Dao, *Weg*). In doing so, I at once theorize the ontology of a renewed, non-methodic CPT and simultaneously contribute to an emerging scholarship on the connection between Chinese and German philosophy.


Within public law, my current research focuses on the role of legal doctrine on the U.S. Supreme Court. Among other things, I'm using natural language processing to develop new scaling mechanisms that estimate judicial outcomes in novel ways (i.e., along jurisprudential dimensions instead of ideological ones). Code for some of my ongoing projects is available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mattdahl).
