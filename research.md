Currently, my main project is titled "Laozi, Heidegger, and the Way of Comparative Political Theory." Paper available on request. Abstract below:


> Comparative political theory (CPT) is experiencing a crisis in methodology. Its literature is consumed with debates about the “how” rather than the “what”; disputes over procedure sideline substantive political inquiry. In this paper, I argue that this fixation on methodology is dangerous: Framing CPT in the grammar of Western science ultimately hinders, not helps, the goal of taking non-Western political thought seriously. To show this, I excavate two *non*-methodic ways of conducting cross-cultural inquiry, centered around Laozi and Heidegger’s similar concepts of “the Way.” In doing so, I at once furnish the resources necessary to critique CPT’s prevailing methodic tendencies and simultaneously contribute to an emerging understanding of the relationship between Chinese and German philosophy.


I also do research in judicial politics. Code for my ongoing projects is available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mattdahl). Currently, I am interested in the intersection of legal doctrine and judicial decision-making, and the ways we can employ natural language processing (NLP) to advance that area of study.
