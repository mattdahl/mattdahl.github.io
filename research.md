Within CPT, my current project is titled "More than Method: Laozi, Heidegger, and the Ontology of Comparative Political Theory." Paper available on request. Abstract below:

> Comparative political theory (CPT) is experiencing a crisis in methodology. Its literature is consumed with debates about the “how” rather than the “what”; disputes over procedure sideline substantive political inquiry. In this paper, I argue that this fixation on methodology is not only distracting but dangerous: By focusing so much on the role of method, CPT unwittingly propagates Western assumptions about both the nature of politics (political ontology) and the nature of academic research (political epistemology), undercutting its professed goal to deparochialize the discipline. To show this, I examine the twentieth-century cross-cultural encounter between Heidegger and Laozi and recover their shared concept of “the Way” (道, Dao, *Weg*). In doing so, I at once theorize the ontological basis for a renewed, non-methodic CPT and simultaneously contribute to an emerging scholarship on the connection between Chinese and German philosophy.


I also do research in judicial politics. Code for my ongoing projects is available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/mattdahl). Currently, I am interested in the intersection of legal doctrine and judicial decision-making, and the ways that natural language processing (NLP) can advance that area of study.
